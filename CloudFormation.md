# AWS CloudFormation

* **Building Blocks:** It is a language that gives you building blocks to describe the infrastructure you want to provision in AWS.
* **Text files:** Containing the description that is formatted in JSON and YAML. In this, you can version it and track changes like any other piece of code.

### When And Where To Use AWS CloudFormation?
* When you have to deploy infrastructure rather than doing it manually.
* To create a repeatable patterned environment, e.g. a WordPress blog and a database if you were running a web hosting business.
* To run automated testing for CI/CD environments. Create a dedicated, clean environment, inject your code, run testing, produce results, then delete the test environment, all with no human input.
* To define an environment all at once, and have it deployed to any region in the AWS Cloud without reconfiguration.
* To manage infrastructure configuration using software development style versioning and code repositories such as git.

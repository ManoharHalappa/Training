**Amazon S3** is an Object Storage built to store and retrieve any data from anywhere. It is known to be a promising, stable, and highly scalable online storage solution.

## What is Amazon S3 Bucket?

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a storage that can be maintained and accessed over the Internet. Amazon S3 provides a web service that can be used to store and retrieve an unlimited amount of data. It is global by default and bucket are region specified.

S3 in Amazon has two entities called buckets and objects. Objects are stored inside buckets.

By default, the maximum number of buckets that can be created per account is 100. For additional buckets, one can submit a request for a service limit increase.

Now if you go to the image (here k21.png), you’ll find a URL. If you try to access these files outside the premises of AWS through URL it will deny your request.

Consider an example in which we have created an S3 bucket “mandemo” with default permissions. when we try to access it shows the below error page:

Therefore, we need to change the default setting and grant file public access.

# Steps To Grant S3 Bucket Public Access  

**Step 1:** Go to your Amazon S3 console.

**Step 2:** Click on the name of the Amazon S3 bucket from the list. If it’s still in its default access state, it should say “Buckets and objects not public”.

**Step 3:** Go to the Permissions tab. The first sub-tab, which is open by default, is Block Public Access, and the “Block all public access” option will be On. Click on the Edit button.

* Uncheck the “Block all public access” option, and then click on the Save changes button. It will ask to confirm the change but typing in the word “confirm”.
* Go to the file which needs public access and move to the Object Actions drop-down menu and click on “Make Public“. You will see another window and click on Make Public

**Step 4:** Now go to the object again and you can find the file’s Object URL.

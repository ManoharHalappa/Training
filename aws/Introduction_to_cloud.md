# What Is Cloud Computing?

  * Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the 
    Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
  * With cloud computing, you don’t need to make large upfront investments in hardware and spend a lot of time on the heavy lifting of managing that hardware. 
    Instead, you can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need to power your newest bright idea or operate your IT department. 
  * You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly, and only pay for what you use.
  * Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a broad set of application services over the Internet. 
  * A cloud services platform such as Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, 
    while you provision and use what you need via a web application.
    
## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

* Trade capital expense for variable expense – Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.

* Benefit from massive economies of scale – By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.

* Stop guessing capacity – Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.

* Increase speed and agility – In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

* Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers – Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.

* Go global in minutes – Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

# Types of Cloud Computing

## Cloud Computing Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  * **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  * **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
  * **Software as a Service (SaaS)** provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email which you can use to send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintain the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.

### Examples Of IAAS, PAAS, SAAS are:

  **IAAS:** DigitalOcean, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine

  **PAAS:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Windows Azure, Force.com, OpenShift, Apache Stratos.

  **SAAS:** Google Apps, Salesforce, Dropbox, MailChimp, ZenDesk, DocuSign, Slack, Hubspot.
  
# Cloud Computing Deployment Models

## Cloud
  * A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud. Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing. Cloud-based applications can be built on low-level infrastructure pieces or can use higher level services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure.

## Hybrid
  * A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure to extend, and grow, an organization's infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to the internal system. For more information on how AWS can help you with your hybrid deployment, visit our Hybrid Cloud with AWS page.

## On-premises
  * The deployment of resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes called the “private cloud.” On-premises deployment doesn’t provide many of the benefits of cloud computing but is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources. In most cases this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure while using application management and virtualization technologies to try and increase resource utilization.

# Global Infrastructure
  * AWS serves over a million active customers in more than 240 countries and territories.
  * The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. (An AWS Region is a physical location in the world where we have multiple Availability Zones.)
  * **80 Availability Zones**
  * **25 geographic Regions**
  * **220+ Points of Presense** (Edge Locations and Edge Caches)
  
  ## What is the difference between the AWS Region and Availability Zone?
  * AWS Cloud computing resources are housed in highly available data center facilities. AWS Regions are huge and generally scattered into independent geographic areas. 
    Availability Zones are distinct locations within an AWS Region that are designed to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones.

  ## What is the main difference between an availability zone and an edge location?
  * Availability zones are a bunch of data centers that host all your resources. Edge locations are the small data centers that host static & dynamic web contents.

# Security
  ## Benefits of AWS Security
  * Keep Your Data Safe: The AWS infrastructure puts strong safeguards in place to help protect your privacy. All data is stored in highly secure AWS data centers.

  * Meet Compliance Requirements: AWS manages dozens of compliance programs in its infrastructure. This means that segments of your compliance have already been completed.

  * Save Money: Cut costs by using AWS data centers. Maintain the highest standard of security without having to manage your own facility

  * Scale Quickly: Security scales with your AWS Cloud usage. No matter the size of your business, the AWS infrastructure is designed to keep your data safe.

# Compliance
The IT infrastructure that AWS provides to its customers is designed and managed in alignment with best security practices and a variety of IT security standards. The following is a partial list of assurance programs with which AWS complies:

* SOC 1/ISAE 3402, SOC 2, SOC 3

* FISMA, DIACAP, and FedRAMP

* PCI DSS Level 1

* ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018

# Cost Management

## AWS savings Plan
Amazon describes Savings Plans as â€œA new flexible pricing model which helps you save up to 72% on EC2 and Fargate usage. Customers simply commit to a consistent amount of usage (e.g. $10/hour) over 1 or 3 years, and in exchange they will receive a discount for that usage

## AWS reserved instances
An Amazon Reserved Instance (RI) is a billing discount that allows you to save on your Amazon EC2 usage costs. ... Zonal Reserved Instances allow you to create a capacity reservation for an instance type within a specific Availability Zone. Zonal RIs also provide substantial discounts over On-Demand Pricing.

## AWS dedicated host
An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirements. 

## AWS Spot instance
A Spot Instance is an instance that uses spare EC2 capacity that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. The hourly price for a Spot Instance is called a Spot price

## AWS On-demand
On-Demand Instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (minimum of 60 seconds) with no long-term commitments. This frees you from the costs and complexities of planning, purchasing, and maintaining hardware and transforms what are commonly large fixed costs into much smaller variable costs.

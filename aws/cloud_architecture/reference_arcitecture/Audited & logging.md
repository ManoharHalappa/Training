# Audited & logging

* Enable logging to gain operational insight and visibility. Governance and auditing is important as we can't secure what we can't track.
  * Optimise logging Cloud Trail, CloudWatch logs, WAF logs, VPC Flow Logs, S3 access logs etc
  * Maintain lists of assets (optimise Service Catalog) and build risk registers
  * Manage life cycles and secure logs
  * Configure service and application logging and automate response to events

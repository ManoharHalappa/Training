# Scalability

* Design a scalable plan to ensure workloads can adapt to meet new levels of demand. Design a scalable architecture with the ability to handle bursts of traffic or heavy loads with little or no notice, especially during peak times, without an impact on performance.
  * Monitoring can make scaling easier e.g enable detailed monitoring to get CloudWatch metric data to ensure a faster response to load changes and enable Auto Scaling group metrics.

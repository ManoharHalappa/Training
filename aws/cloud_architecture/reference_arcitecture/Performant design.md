# Performant design

* Include design principles to help optimise assets within workloads and also achieve and maintain secure, scalable, cost efficient and operational workloads.
  * Adopt serverless architectures, removing the requirement to build and operate physical infrastructure.
  * Review how your application scales, implement caching services and adopting event-driven architectures.
  * Improve efficiency through innovation - continually review your architecture and design choices on a regular basis to take advantage of the latest services.
  * Implement observability and build monitoring into your application to allow you to track performance of your applications and feed back into the development lifecycle to improve overall performance for the end users in production.
  * Identify where your opportunities are for increased efficiency. For example, if you are looking to optimise your lambda functions, you would want to monitor and identify the highest latency and highest volume lambdas which affect user experience and target improving these.

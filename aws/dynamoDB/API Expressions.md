# Expressions

There are five types of expressions in DynamoDB:
## **Key Condition Expressions:** 
Used in the Query API call to describe which items you want to retrieve in your query

Examples:

~~~
result = dynamodb.query( 
  TableName='MovieRoles', 
  KeyConditionExpression="#a = :a", 
  ExpressionAttributeNames={
          "#a": "Actor"
  },
  ExpressionAttributeValues={
          ":a": { "S": "Natalie Portman" }
  }
)
~~~

~~~
result = dynamodb.query(
  TableName='MovieRoles', 
  KeyConditionExpression="#a = :a AND #m < :title", 
  ExpressionAttributeNames={
    "#a": "Actor",   
     "#m": "Movie" 
  },   
  ExpressionAttributeValues={
      ":a": { "S": "Natalie Portman" },
      ":title": { "S": "N" }
  }
)
~~~

## **Filter Expressions:** 

Used in Query and Scan operations to describe which items should be returned to the client after finding items that 

The key difference with a filter expression vs. a key condition expression is that a filter expression can be applied on any attribute in the table, 
not just those in the primary key.

**Note**

When you issue a Query or Scan request to DynamoDB, DynamoDB performs the following actions in order:

First, it reads items matching your Query or Scan from the database. Second, if a filter expression is present, it filters out items from the results that donâ€™t match the filter expression. Third, it returns any remaining items to the client.
However, the key point to understand is that the Query and Scan operations will return a maximum of 1MB of data, and this limit is applied in step 1, before the filter expression is applied.

## **Projection Expressions:** 

Used in all read operations to describe which attributes you want to return on items that were read


## **Condition Expressions:** 

Used in write operations to assert the existing condition (or non-condition) of an item before writing to it

## **Update Expressions:** 

Used in the UpdateItem call to describe the desired updates to an existing item
